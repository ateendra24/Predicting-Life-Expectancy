# Life Expectancy Prediction using IBM Watson AutoAI

This project utilizes IBM Watson Studio's AutoAI capabilities to analyze a global Life Expectancy dataset. The objective is to automatically preprocess the data, select relevant features, train multiple machine learning models, and identify the best-performing pipeline for predicting life expectancy. AutoAI streamlines the process by handling data cleaning, algorithm selection, and hyperparameter optimization. The final model is evaluated for accuracy and deployed as a REST API for real-time predictions.

## üéØ Project Overview

The project focuses on predicting life expectancy based on various health, social, and economic factors across different countries. Using IBM Watson Studio's AutoAI, we automatically generate and compare multiple machine learning pipelines to find the optimal solution for this regression problem.
