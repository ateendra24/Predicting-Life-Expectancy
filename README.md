# Life Expectancy Prediction using IBM Watson AutoAI

This project utilizes IBM Watson Studio's AutoAI capabilities to analyze a global Life Expectancy dataset. The objective is to automatically preprocess the data, select relevant features, train multiple machine learning models, and identify the best-performing pipeline for predicting life expectancy. AutoAI streamlines the process by handling data cleaning, algorithm selection, and hyperparameter optimization. The final model is evaluated for accuracy and deployed as a REST API for real-time predictions.
